# Battery-overcharging-alarm
a python program to alarm you when your battery is fully charged
# Why did I code this program?
>It isn't possible to overcharge a laptop battery. Leaving your computer plugged in after it is fully charged doesn't overcharge or damage the battery. However, keeping the battery consistently on the charger may not be the best idea if your goal is to optimize the battery life of your laptop.
